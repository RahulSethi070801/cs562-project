Post 15: Made it to the big stage atAI EngineerWorld's Fair last month! Took the opportunity to share some ofCodeium's secret sauce. Here’s what I presented:Talk title: “Are embeddings actually limiting AI agents? How Codeium Breaks Through the Ceiling for Retrieval”Embeddings have been the gold standard for retrieval for years, but they’ve hit a ceiling. Even the largest models are within a few percentage points of each other on MTEB (massive text embedding benchmark).Enter Codeium’s vertical integration. This means we:1. Train our own models2. Build custom infrastructure down to the metal3. Are product driven, not research drivenThe result is we can run massive, workflow-specific LLMs at a speed and efficiency unmatched by the competition. Think of this as: we spend $0.01 for every LLM call instead of $1.00. If you are a Codeium user, we’re willing to throw you 100x calls since that’s what will give you the highest quality code.Low cost —> more compute —> higher quality product experienceWe exploited this fundamental business advantage by building “M-Query,” a system that runs parallel LLM calls on every item in your codebase.Imagine asking “I want to do X, is file Y relevant?” on every single piece of code. We can get a ranked list of every relevant piece of code in your team’s repository within seconds.All this, so that our users & customers can generate the highest quality code conditioned on their existing codebase(s), documentation, organizational standards, best practices, and more.DMs open if you want to discuss or hear more about what we’re working on! It takes a village, our team is hiring 🙂Thanks so much toShawn swyx WandBenjamin Dunphyfor inviting me to speak. And shoutout to the whole Codeium team for building a killer product.The full talk is linked in the comments below.…more

Post 16: Most companies view AI as a simple tool for aggregation.With generative AI becoming more accessible, it's easy to unify everything.But in fields like aerospace or defense, over-aggregation is a real risk.The impasse?Location, customer data, and tradecraft—individually harmless—can turn classified when linked together.Suddenly, you’re in hot water you never saw coming.The complexity of controlling what gets aggregated—and the consequences of getting it wrong—makes it a much tougher challenge.In this episode,John Russell, CIO ofNorthrop Grumman, drives home how AI’s application for national security is immense, but for some, the risks loom just as large.…more

Post 17: Without rewiring how people work, tech alone is suboptimal.Remember when employees who resisted PowerPoint and Excel were phased out?Now, AI represents an even bigger shift.Shifting entrenched behaviors and routines is tough, especially when people are comfortable.That’s why only digitally native companies are built to embrace this change.In contrast, those accustomed to traditional roles often resist, viewing change as a threat.John Russell, CIO ofNorthrop Grumman, believes the real breakthrough will come when employees disrupt their own roles to make room for new opportunities.…more

Post 18: AI isn’t ready to take over… just yet.Deloitte reported that 62% of enterprises cited data quality as a major barrier to AI implementation.AI still struggles to bridge the gap between understanding intent and executing complex, context-aware tasks.Today’s models have difficulty with even basic, context-sensitive tasks like ordering coffee based on your calendar.Limitations in contextual awareness hinder AI from reaching its full potential.In the next 5, 10, or even 20 years, these gaps may close as AI advances.Mike Hamilton, CIO ofCloudflare, emphasizes that as AI becomes more ingrained in our lives, its primary goals will remain:- mitigating human error- enhancing safety protocols, and- streamlining complex workflowsLike what you read?Tune in to the full conversation with Mike here:https://lnkd.in/dwpWHS6s…more

Post 19: GPT-4 has a 3% hallucination rate, while Google’s PaLM 2 nears 27%.Even with billions poured into their development, the best LLMs still struggle with contextual comprehension.Ask how to make pizza, and it might suggest using glue to stick the cheese.Why?Because it lacks real-world experience and context.It can write unit tests but doesn’t grasp the broader goal of ensuring code quality.Because its responses are only as good as the datasets it’s been trained on.We discuss this and more in EP 02 of Floating Points, featuringMike Hamilton, CIO ofCloudflare.Watch here ↓https://lnkd.in/dwpWHS6s…more

Post 20: Blaming your team is self-sabotage; as a leader you need to own the outcome.Ever notice how some leaders blame their team or resources when things go south?Imagine two neighbors decide to plant gardens. They buy the same plants from the same store.One just dumps them in the ground, while the other tweaks and nurtures.Leadership works the same way. It’s about being proactive, like that second neighbor.Nurturing a talented team means incentivizing them with a lot more than just $$$.Our guest on EP 02 of Floating Points,Mike Hamilton, CIO ofCloudflare, says it’s all about:- giving your team purpose,- room to grow, and- a supportive culture to really drive excellence.If you’re a tech leader trying to optimize your team’s performance, watch the full episode here:https://lnkd.in/dwpWHS6s…more

Post 21: Over 82% of Americans fear the nefarious potential of AI in identity theft.When building the right systems, companies must force themselves to think from the user’s POV.At the crux of it, users are only worried about their data:Will it be kept private? Will there be security risks??These aren’t just theoretical concerns; they’re system issues that can make or break an AI product.If you don’t handle privacy and security right…You’re taking a BIG RISK with potential compliance failures and data breaches.Bhawna Singh, CTO ofOkta, tells all about how a deeper focus on protecting user identity will foster more valuable interactions with AI.Tune in to the complete conversation here:https://lnkd.in/dkD72npG…more

Post 24: Watch the AI perform a dozen consistent edits across multiple files in less than a minute. All from a single instruction. No editing magic. 😮Let’s deep dive into Cortex, the reasoning engine of the future.Code assistants today are “single shot” - even with a very advanced context awareness system and complex pre-and-post processing logic, at the core there is a single LLM inference. Cortex breaks down a task similar to a developer - retrieve all of the snippets across the codebase that are relevant, semantically plan all of the steps, and then execute each of those steps.- Breakthrough No. 1: We have built a proprietary foundational code LLM that can scale reasoning over variable amounts of context, tested on over 100M tokens of code with no degradation in quality. And we can do this cheaply because of our infrastructure background.- Breakthrough No. 2: AI is always going to make mistakes on an unknown and changing set of tasks. Value comes from getting results quickly. Failing fast is ok, failing slow is not. Cortex can process millions of tokens in seconds.- Breakthrough No. 3: If the AI can fail fast but be explainable, then a human can correct the AI to course correct quickly to successful, useful results. Cortex enables new human-in-the-loop interactions.Cortex is a huge step forwards in helping developers solve more complex problems faster, allowing them to approach challenges in a more powerful way than they were able to before. We have already started integrating Cortex into our existing products. For example, we use Cortex to rapidly identify relevant context items for any Chat message even better, and now our Chat retrieval doubles the recall of the leading embedding-based methods. The video shown here is from Cascade, a prototype product that is the first to natively expose the emergent behavior from Cortex. Join the waitlist here:https://lnkd.in/ejq3zR2rWe solve the big underlying problems in the generative AI space so that we can drive the best experience to our users.

Post 37: Today, we are rolling out a better chat experience than ChatGPT for software developers. Chat has always been an important part of the Codeium experience, but now we believe it is the best chat experience for anyone writing code.What makes it the best? A combination of model, reasoning, UX, and accessibility. The same ingredients to any great AI product. As a company, we have full control of the entire stack, so we have innovated on all axes.⚙ Model: Today, we are deploying a Llama 3.1-70B based Codeium chat model for all users, and an additional Llama 3.1-405B based Codeium chat model for all paying users. The Codeium versions of these models are tightly integrated with our reasoning stack, leading to better quality suggestions than GPT-4 for coding tasks, and are hosted on our industry leading infrastructure so that we can offer them for free (or very cheaply) to our users.🧠 Reasoning: We are rolling out our next generation retrieval engine, which has a recall that is 2x better than state-of-the-art embedding-based RAG systems. Simply put, all of our users will now get more relevant, grounded Chat responses.🖋 UX: We are rolling out a large suite of UX features and improvements: inline citations, chat history, slash commands, inline context pinning, deep insights, copy to clipboard, and a whole lot more.🌐 Accessibility: Chat in more IDEs than any other tool - Visual Studio Code, Jetbrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, XCode. If you need it self-hosted for your enterprise, we can do that too. Oh and also available on the web via Codeium Live. We don’t care how you work, we just want to help you work better.There really is no Chat experience quite like Codeium’s in the world of software development. It is likely one of the reasons why developers on Stack Overflow self-reported Codeium as driving more productivity and satisfaction than any other tool, including GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.Read more about all of the improvements we have made to Chat on our blog, and use Codeium yourself, for free:https://lnkd.in/dhbqR_vK…more
